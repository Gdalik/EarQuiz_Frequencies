### Greetings!

*EarQuiz Frequencies* is a software for technical ear training. It aims to help musicians 
and all kinds of audio professionals or students (producers, recording/mixing/mastering/live sound engineers, 
audio designers, etc.) develop and master the ability to aurally recognize frequency bands. In fact, anybody 
who wants to teach himself/herself how to adjust an audio system with equalizer by ear consciously may find it useful.

This application is based on (and deeply inspired by) the world-renowned *[Golden Ears](https://goldenearsaudio.com/)* method of David Moulton, 
whose course is half dedicated to building this essential critical listening skill. The pre-built presets generally 
follow his easy-to-difficult patterns, but you can also adjust the settings to go far beyond their boundaries.
Educators in the audio industry may use this software to produce superb quality training and test materials for their students 
almost in no time.

The programme is distributed under [GNU GPL v3 License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html). So, it is Free for any use, 
either personal or commercial!

### The Basic Training Method

<a id="the-basic-exercise-principle">The overall training process involves ongoing learning and testing yourself</a>.
Both learning and test exercises consist of audio samples, which we will call *examples*. Each example is a 10-30 
seconds long chunk of either **[pink noise](#pink-noise)** (generated on each application launch) or **music**.  
Technically, any external audio file of a [supported format](#supported-audio-formats), stored locally on your device, can be used instead for the latter.
So, you could further experiment with recordings of speech, different sounds, natural or synthetic noises, 
whatever you have in your audio collection.

The method behind every example is fairly simple. It begins normally, with no spectral changes. After several seconds, 
the octave or 1/3-octave graphic equalizer (EQ) which boosts or cuts the amplitude of one or two frequency bands, is switched on 
automatically. After some more seconds, the EQ is switched off again, and the sound is returned to its normal 
(non-equalized) state.

*Note: The current proportion of equalized part length versus sum length of non-equalized ones is hard-coded at 40/60 per cent.
Therefore, if we have 10 seconds length example, this would be: 3sec **EQ Off**, 4sec **EQ On**, and 
3sec **EQ Off** respectively.
The option to adjust this setting is planned to be introduced in future versions.*

Regardless of the audio source material and the EQ settings, the recommended approach remains the same.
- First, you **learn** and warm-up by listening to examples, trying to [memorize and internalize](#remembering-frequencies) 
the sound of different frequency ranges. <br /> *Don't be scared; just relax, listen, watch the
highlighted frequency values on the screen, and let your brains do the job ;-)!*
- Second, you take a **test** which is nothing but a sequence of ten similar examples with randomly chosen frequency values 
and boost/cut options (where available), which you guess, and get a score to track your progress.

<br />

### Choosing Acoustic Device
If you can do these exercises in a well treated room with studio quality monitors, it is great, 
but not obligatory. Decent consumer systems that do not add obvious distortion, crackling noises, etc. to sound 
at tolerably loud levels, and reproduce a wide frequency range 
([see further](#adjusting-system) about checking this), can also meet our requirements. 

You can use quality headphones as well. It is much easier and cheaper to achieve the accurate sound with them, 
one of the main reasons being that it is not affected by the room acoustics. Be aware, though, that pitch and loudness 
perception in headphones may significantly differ from the experience with loudspeakers. And you cannot feel the sound 
with your whole body this way, which may be especially important for analysing the lower end of the spectrum.
<br />

### Checking Audio Playback

Obvious, but important: make sure your audio system is switched on, and the playback audio path is working properly.
By default, the programme uses your system sound output device. But you can easily switch to any available 
audio playback device, selecting **Audio | Audio Device** menu item from the main menu.

Initially, the audio source is set to **Pink noise** so that the software would not require any external files to 
get up and running. And it is usually the best starting point for your practice session. So, make sure the corresponding
option is selected in the **Audio Source** window.

Are you ready to hear the sound :-)? Just press the 
**Learn** mode button **or** change the position of any EQ slider by dragging/clicking on it, which will switch the application
to the *Learn* mode automatically. After some processing (peak normalization and equalization) and loading, which usually takes fractions of second
on contemporary machines, the playback of an example should start.

*Here, you may want to proceed with the training process. But I suggest that we should **adjust your
audio system** first.* <br />

### Adjusting Audio System
<a id="adjusting-system">The flatter, the better.</a> I mean frequency response of your whole playback system, of course.
If your audio path contains any tone controls, equalizers, or sound processors, which affect the spectrum of reproduced sound,
in most cases they should be switched off or set flat, unless you know for sure that they compensate for the certain flaws. If you have the 
loudness compensation button on your playback preamp or receiver, it should be off as well.

As for the volume, the main idea here is to set the comfortable level for the whole Learn/Test exercise cycle with the same audio stuff
and EQ pattern, without changing the loudness during or between separate examples. Please note that our frequency 
perception is heavily influenced by the sound level (for more details, see studies by Fletcher and Munson on this topic).
So, at this stage, it makes sense to adjust the volume to a comfortable medium loud level while you check the audio playback 
using pink noise and current EQ pattern. You may need to reconsider it later for different EQ patterns/settings or other audio sources.

There is a **Volume Slider** with the level indicator both in percents (slider value) and decibels (relative amplitude level), 
which can be accessed from the **Transport Panel**. The latter can be opened from various places, including top-right corner of the **Audio Source** window and **View** menu 
of the main menu.

You mentally connect the highlighted frequency numbers with certain pitches, 
make your own associations (both aural and non-aural/"synesthetic"), note and try to describe the changes in 
character/timbre of different sounds.
