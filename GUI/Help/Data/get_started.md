### Greetings!

*EarQuiz Frequencies* is a software for technical ear training. It aims to help musicians 
and all kinds of audio professionals or students (producers, recording/mixing/mastering/live sound engineers, 
audio designers, etc.) develop and master the ability to aurally recognize frequency bands. In fact, anybody 
who wants to teach himself/herself how to adjust an audio system with equalizer by ear consciously may find it useful.

This application is based on (and deeply inspired by) the world-renowned *Golden Ears* method of David Moulton, 
whose course is half dedicated to building this essential critical listening skill. The pre-built presets generally 
follow his easy-to-difficult patterns, but you can also adjust the settings to go far beyond their boundaries.
Educators in the audio industry may use this software to produce superb quality training and test materials for their students 
almost in no time.
And it is free for **any** use either personal or commercial!

### The Basic Exercise Principle

<a id="the-basic-exercise-principle">Both</a> learning and test exercises are sets or sequences of audio samples, which we will call *examples*. Each example is a 10-30 
seconds long chunk of either **[pink noise](#pink-noise)** (generated on each application launch) or **music**.  
Technically, any external audio file of a [supported format](#supported-audio-formats), stored locally on your device, can be used instead for the latter.
So, you could further experiment with recordings of speech, different sounds, natural or synthetic noises, 
whatever you have in your audio collection.

The principle behind every example is fairly simple. It begins normally, with no spectral changes. After several seconds, 
the octave or 1/3-octave graphic equalizer (EQ) which boosts or cuts the amplitude of one or two frequency bands, is switched on 
automatically. After some more seconds, the EQ is switched off again, and the sound is returned to its normal 
(non-equalized) state.

*Note: The current proportion of equalized part length versus sum length of non-equalized ones is hard-coded at 40/60 per cent.
Therefore, if we have 10 seconds length example, this would be: 3sec **EQ Off**, 4sec **EQ On**, and 
3sec **EQ Off** respectively.
The option to adjust this setting is planned to be introduced in future versions.*

Regardless of the audio source material and the EQ settings, the recommended approach stays the same.
- First, you **learn** and warm-up by listening to the examples, trying to memorize and internalize 
the sound of different frequency ranges. You mentally connect the highlighted frequency numbers with certain pitches, 
make your own associations (both aural and non-aural/"synesthetic"), note the changes in character/timbre of different sounds.
- Second, you take a **test** which is nothing but a set of ten similar examples, where you guess the boosted or cut 
frequencies, and get a score to track your progress.
